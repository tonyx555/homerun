"""Stuck-position surveillance for blocked-terminal exits.

Institutional-grade pattern: when the bot's exit submission has been
permanently blocked (e.g. ``pending_live_exit.status =
'blocked_persistent_timeout'`` because the CLOB no longer accepts
orders for the underlying market), we DO NOT auto-write a synthetic
loss.  That would violate the DB-layer P&L guard
(``_enforce_pnl_verification_guard``) which requires
``verification_status='wallet_activity'`` for ``actual_profit`` to
persist — the guard exists precisely so phantom P&L cannot be created
by inference paths.

Instead, this module does what a bank's exception queue does:

  1. **SCAN**: query the DB for orders whose ``pending_live_exit.status``
     is in ``_BLOCKED_TERMINAL_STATES`` and whose age exceeds
     ``_STUCK_AGE_HOURS``.
  2. **VERIFY ON-CHAIN**: for each, ask the chain (via
     ``CTFExecutionService.fetch_position_chain_status``) what the wallet
     actually holds for that conditional token, and whether the
     underlying CTF condition has resolved.  This is on-chain truth,
     bypassing Polymarket's data API entirely.
  3. **CLASSIFY** (no writes — pure observation):

       * ``recovered_externally``  : balance == 0.  Position is gone.
                                      The polymarket_trade_verifier will
                                      pick up the SELL/redemption in its
                                      next 5-minute cycle.  No action.
       * ``redemption_pending``    : balance > 0 AND market_resolved.
                                      The redeemer_worker will redeem on
                                      its next 120-second cycle.  No
                                      action — just observe.
       * ``pending_resolution``    : balance > 0 AND market unresolved
                                      AND market_end_date is within
                                      ``_PENDING_RESOLUTION_WINDOW_DAYS``.
                                      The market is about to close on
                                      its own; once it resolves the
                                      redeemer worker handles it.
                                      Counted but NEVER alerted —
                                      paging the operator about a
                                      position that will resolve itself
                                      within days is noise.
       * ``transient_client_failure``: balance > 0 AND market unresolved
                                      AND last_error is a client-side
                                      failure.  The lifecycle's
                                      auto-recovery will retry the
                                      SELL.  Counted but NEVER alerted.
       * ``operator_intervention`` : balance > 0 AND market unresolved
                                      AND market_end_date is far AND
                                      last_error matches a venue-
                                      rejection marker AND age >
                                      ``_STUCK_AGE_HOURS``.  This is
                                      the rare residual case: the
                                      venue is genuinely refusing the
                                      SELL, the market won't resolve
                                      on its own soon, and the retry
                                      circuit is already broken.  Alert
                                      via Telegram with informational
                                      framing — most of the time the
                                      operator just acknowledges and
                                      lets the redeemer handle it on
                                      eventual resolution.

  4. **ALERT** the operator on ``operator_intervention`` rows with
     enough context to take a manual action (link to the order, market
     ID, current chain state, expected unrecoverable loss).  The
     operator either waits, intervenes via Polymarket UI, or uses the
     manual-writeoff API (see ``backend/api/routes_operator.py``) which
     writes a verified ``manual_writeoff`` close with full audit trail.

This module NEVER writes to ``actual_profit`` and NEVER mutates
``trader_orders`` rows.  It is pure surveillance.

Tunables come from ``config.Settings`` so they can be adjusted via
env vars without a deploy:

  * STUCK_POSITION_AGE_HOURS         — default 6h
  * STUCK_POSITION_SCAN_INTERVAL_S   — default 300s (every 5 minutes)
  * STUCK_POSITION_ALERT_COOLDOWN_S  — default 21600s (6h between
                                       alerts on the same order)

    Framing is deliberately *informational*, not "needs operator
    review".  By the time we reach this code path:

      * The position is at least ``_STUCK_AGE_HOURS`` (6h) old.
      * The 5-minute auto-recovery has tried and failed enough times
        to drive ``pending_live_exit.status`` into a blocked-terminal
        state.
      * On-chain truth confirms we still hold shares.
      * The market is not resolved yet.
      * The market end_date is more than
        ``_PENDING_RESOLUTION_WINDOW_DAYS`` away.
      * The last_error matches a real venue-rejection marker (not a
        client-side timeout).

    Even then, the right operator response is usually "do nothing":
    when the market eventually resolves, the redeemer closes it.
    The manual-writeoff API exists for the rare case where the
    operator has external evidence the position is truly worthless
    and wants to clear it from the dashboard before resolution.

    Hence: lead with chain truth, present the manual-writeoff CTA
    as optional, never use language that implies an SLA.
