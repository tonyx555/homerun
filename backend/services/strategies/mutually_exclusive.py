    Strategy 2: Mutually Exclusive Arbitrage

    Find two events where only one can be true, buy YES on both for < $1

    WARNING: This strategy has SIGNIFICANT RISKS!

    KNOWN ISSUES:
    1. Third-party candidates: "Democrats win" vs "Republicans win" ignores independents
    2. Pattern matching false positives: Keywords may match unrelated markets
    3. Draw/tie outcomes: In sports, both "win" options could lose if there's a draw
    4. Different thresholds: "above $100K" vs "below $100K" leaves a gap at exactly $100K

    ONLY use this strategy when:
    - The event has EXACTLY 2 markets (enforced)
    - You have MANUALLY verified the outcomes are truly exhaustive
    - No third option exists (no independents, no draws, no boundary cases)

    Example of FAILURE:
    - "Democrats win 2028" YES: $0.45
    - "Republicans win 2028" YES: $0.52
    - Independent candidate wins
    - BOTH positions resolve to $0

    Example (true binary):
    - "Bill passes" YES: $0.45
    - "Bill fails" YES: $0.52
    - Total: $0.97 (assuming pass/fail is truly exhaustive)
    - One MUST win = $1.00 payout
    - Profit: $0.03
