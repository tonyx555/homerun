    Strategy 5: Must-Happen Arbitrage

    Buy YES on ALL possible outcomes when total < $1.00
    One outcome MUST happen, guaranteeing a $1 payout.

    WARNING: This strategy has SIGNIFICANT RISKS!

    The strategy uses keyword heuristics ("winner", "who will", etc.) to guess
    that outcomes are exhaustive, but CANNOT VERIFY this is actually true.

    KNOWN ISSUES:
    1. Hidden candidates: "Who wins the election?" may show 3 candidates but
       there could be others not displayed in the markets
    2. "None of the above": Some events allow outcomes not listed
    3. Cancellation/postponement: Events can be cancelled, voiding all bets
    4. Rule changes: Resolution criteria may change

    ONLY trust this strategy when:
    - The event is explicitly flagged as NegRisk by Polymarket (use NegRisk strategy instead)
    - You have MANUALLY verified the outcomes cover ALL possibilities
    - The event rules explicitly state one outcome must win

    Example of FAILURE:
    - "Who wins the 2024 primary?" with markets for A, B, C
    - Candidate D enters the race and wins
    - All your YES positions resolve to $0

    Example (Multi-candidate election):
    - Candidate A YES: $0.30
    - Candidate B YES: $0.35
    - Candidate C YES: $0.32
    - Total: $0.97
    - ASSUMED one must win = $1.00
    - Profit: $0.03 (IF assumptions hold)
