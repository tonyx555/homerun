Strategy 8: Settlement Lag Arbitrage

Exploits delayed price updates after an outcome has been determined but
prices haven't fully adjusted yet.

From Kroer et al. Part 2 (Section IV, Type 3 mispricing):
- When outcomes settle, Polymarket prices don't instantly lock
- They drift toward 0 or 1 as traders bet against resolved outcomes
- This creates multi-hour arbitrage windows

Example (from paper): Assad remaining President of Syria through 2024:
- Assad flees country (outcome determined)
- Prices: YES = $0.30, NO = $0.30 (sum = 0.60)
- Should be: YES = $0, NO = $1
- Arbitrage window lasted hours

Detection approach:
1. Find markets where resolution conditions are likely met
2. Check if prices haven't fully adjusted (far from 0/1)
3. Look for very low YES prices on events that appear resolved
4. Look for events where external signals suggest settlement

    1. Resolution date has passed but market isn't closed yet

       suggesting it's effectively resolved
    3. Sum of prices deviates significantly from $1 near resolution
    4. Recent dramatic price movements suggest outcome is known

    The key insight: Polymarket chose speed over accuracy (Section IV).
    Settlement creates Type 3 mispricing where prices drift rather than
    snap to 0/1 when outcomes resolve.
