Strategy 8: Settlement Lag Arbitrage

Exploits delayed price updates after an outcome has been determined but
prices haven't fully adjusted yet.

From Kroer et al. Part 2 (Section IV, Type 3 mispricing):
- When outcomes settle, Polymarket prices don't instantly lock
- They drift toward 0 or 1 as traders bet against resolved outcomes
- This creates multi-hour arbitrage windows

Example (from paper): Assad remaining President of Syria through 2024:
- Assad flees country (outcome determined)
- Prices: YES = $0.30, NO = $0.30 (sum = 0.60)
- Should be: YES = $0, NO = $1
- Arbitrage window lasted hours

Detection approach:
1. Find markets where resolution conditions are likely met
2. Check if prices haven't fully adjusted (far from 0/1)
3. Look for very low YES prices on events that appear resolved
4. Look for events where external signals suggest settlement

    Settlement Lag Arbitrage: Exploit delayed price adjustments.

    Detects markets where:
    1. Resolution date has passed but market isn't closed yet
    2. One outcome is trading at very low prices (< $0.05)
       suggesting it's effectively resolved
    3. Sum of prices deviates significantly from $1 near resolution
    4. Recent dramatic price movements suggest outcome is known

    The key insight: Polymarket chose speed over accuracy (Section IV).
    Settlement creates Type 3 mispricing where prices drift rather than
    snap to 0/1 when outcomes resolve.
