    Strategy 4: NegRisk / One-of-Many Arbitrage

    For Polymarket-flagged NegRisk events where EXACTLY ONE outcome must win,
    buy YES on all outcomes when total cost < $1.00

    TRUE ARBITRAGE requires mutually exclusive, exhaustive outcomes:
    - Polymarket NegRisk flag: Platform guarantees exactly one outcome wins
    - Multi-outcome elections: "Who wins?" where one candidate must win

    WARNING: Date-based "by X" markets are NOT valid for this strategy!
    - "Event by March", "Event by June", "Event by December" are CUMULATIVE
    - If event happens in March, ALL "by later date" markets also resolve YES
    - Buying NO on all dates = 100% correlated loss if event happens early
    - This is SPECULATIVE, not arbitrage

    Valid Example (Multi-candidate election):
    - Candidate A YES: $0.30
    - Candidate B YES: $0.35
    - Candidate C YES: $0.32
    - Total: $0.97, one must win = $1.00
    - Profit: $0.03 (guaranteed)
