"""
Strategy: Market Making - Provide Liquidity for Profit

Instead of taking existing arbitrage, CREATE profit by providing
liquidity. Place limit orders on both sides of the book and earn
the bid-ask spread.

Key insight: On Polymarket, MAKERS pay 0% fees. This means the
full bid-ask spread is profit.

This is how the most profitable Polymarket bots actually work.
It's not "arbitrage" per se but is the dominant profit mechanism.

The strategy identifies ideal market-making candidates:
- High volume (lots of crossing flow)
- Wide spread (more profit per fill)
- Stable price (less inventory risk)
- Binary markets near 50/50 (maximum two-sided flow)
