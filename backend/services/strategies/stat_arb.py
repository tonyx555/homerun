"""
Strategy: Statistical Arbitrage / Information Edge

Compares Polymarket prices against external probability signals
to find markets where the crowd is wrong.

External signals used:
1. Implied probability from price (YES price = market's probability)
2. Multi-market consensus: average probability across related markets
3. Category base rates: historical resolution rates by category
4. Price momentum: trending markets tend to continue trending
5. Anchoring detection: markets stuck near round numbers (50%, 25%, 75%)

The key insight from the $2.2M bot: ensemble multiple weak signals
into a composite "fair probability" and trade the deviation.

NOT risk-free. This is informed speculation with statistical edge.
