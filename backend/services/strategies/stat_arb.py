"""
Strategy: Statistical Arbitrage / Information Edge

Compares Polymarket prices against external probability signals
to find markets where the crowd is wrong via a weighted ensemble of
weak signals (anchoring, category base rate, multi-market consensus,
momentum, volume-price divergence, favorite-longshot, liquidity
imbalance) producing a composite fair-probability estimate.

NOT risk-free. This is informed speculation with statistical edge.

Two ex-sub-strategies (certainty_shock, temporal_decay) used to live
inline in this file. They have been split into their own strategy
modules so their performance can be tracked independently — both were
weak performers in production.
