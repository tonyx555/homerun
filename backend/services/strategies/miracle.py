Strategy 6: Miracle Market Scanner (Garbage Collection)

Based on the Swisstony strategy that turned $5 into $3.7M.

This strategy identifies markets asking about highly improbable "miracle" events
and bets NO on them. These are not risk-free arbitrage opportunities - they have
a tiny probability of loss. But the probability is so low that consistent execution
across many markets generates reliable profit.

Key insight: "He does not predict the future. He bets against miracles."

Categories of miracle events:
- Apocalypse/World-ending events (WW3, asteroid impact)
- Supernatural events (aliens landing, divine interventions)
- Impossible physics (time travel, FTL communication)
- Celebrity impossibilities (certain deaths by tomorrow, pregnancies)
- Extreme deadline impossibilities (Bitcoin to $1M by Friday)
- Political impossibilities (certain resignations by tomorrow)
- Logical impossibilities (events that already didn't happen)

The strategy:
1. Scan markets for absurd/impossible questions using keyword patterns
2. Find markets where NO is priced at $0.90+ (indicating near-certainty)
3. Calculate expected value: tiny profit per trade, but near-guaranteed
4. Flag stale markets where events already became logically impossible
