"""
Hybrid Retriever -- Weighted composite market retrieval.

Given an extracted event and article text, retrieves candidate markets
using a weighted combination of:
  - keyword_score (BM25 of event entities against market text)
  - semantic_score (cosine similarity of article embedding vs market embedding)
  - event_score (event-type to market-category affinity matrix)
  - entity_overlap_score (entity-type aware overlap between event and market)

Configurable weights from AppSettings.

Pattern from: Quant-tool (multi-factor scoring), Polymarket Agents (RAG retrieval).
