"""
LLM Reranker -- Cuts false positives before expensive edge estimation.

Takes top-K retrieval candidates and calls an LLM to score relevance
of each (article, market) pair. Returns top-N with relevance score
and brief rationale.

Market-type-aware prompting: detects domain (sports, politics, crypto,
entertainment) from the market question/slug and selects a tailored
system prompt that emphasizes domain-relevant signals.

Includes pre-LLM entity-type overlap filtering to reject clearly
mismatched pairs (e.g. baseball article vs basketball market) before
spending LLM budget.

Pattern from: Polymarket Agents (RAG reranking pipeline).
